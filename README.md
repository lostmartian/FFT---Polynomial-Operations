# Fast Fourier Transform
### _Polynomial Multiplication_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)]()

Polynomial Multiplication is a very necessary thing in mathematics and engineering. Finding ways to solve this problem in low time complexity is a big goal. A naive approach can fetch you a O(n^2) algorithm. With FFT we can scale this down to O(nlogn) using Divide and Conquer strategy applied on Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT).
